The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, 
at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, 
not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. 
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant 
image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with 
one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
